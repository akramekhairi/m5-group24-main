# Part II - Fidget Device

This folder contains the code for the second part of the challenge, which involves programming the M5 Atom to function as a fidget device. The code creates a WiFi access point, allowing the user to access a webpage. The device monitors fidgeting and shows information both on the M5 screen and the webpage about the trends of fidgeting. The device is designed to have three modes:
1. Click Mode: In this mode, the device displays a counter which is incremented everytime the user fidgets by pressing the on-screen button. The counter is also displayed on the webpage.
2. Spin Mode: In this mode, the device records the spin time whenever the device is spun by the user and displays it on the webpage. 
3. Art Mode: To reassure the user when fidgeting, the user can draw a pixel art image by clicking the on-screen button.

This code is complemented by the design of a PCB board and a housing to allow some of the functionalities described, such as the spinning mode.
