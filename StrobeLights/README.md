# Part I - M5Atom Bikelight
---
The bikelight can be run by compiling the StrobeLights.ino file and uploading it to the M5Atom (with the [M5Atom library](https://github.com/m5stack/M5Atom) already installed.) Pressing the button will cycle through each mode as described in the exercise description and the main README file.

A few options are available for the description display: changing the symbolic constant `SHOW_DESC` will enable/disable the scrolling display text, and the duration for each character to remain on the screen can be changed with the constant `TXTDUR` (in seconds.)
